# # Conda dependencies for DIALS on all platforms.
#
# This file is interpreted by bootstrap. it uses a HIGHLY limited subset of
# yaml and conda-build selector preprocessing. As such, the file itself is not
# YAML without at minimum preprocessing, and may need full conda-build
# templating to be parseable as yaml directly.
#
# ## Splitting Dependencies
#
# Dependencies are now split here into the categories of build, host, run, as
# per https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#requirements-section
#
# Briefly,
# - `build` is for build and development tools
# - `host` is complicated, but can broadly be considered "build-time"
#   dependencies that are expected to be present on the targeted platform.
#   Please see above conda-build documentation for details, but if you are
#   unsure where a dependency goes, it's probably safest to put it here.
# - `run` are dependencies not used at build-time, but are required for
#   running. Most pure-python packages go here.
# - `test` are dependencies only used to run tests.
#
# ## Filtering dependencies by platform and target
#
# Before use (by bootstrap OR conda), this file is passed through a
# preprocessor. This handles all lines of the form `#[expr]`, and each
# line is filtered out on a line-by-line basis if the expression
# evaluates to false.
#
# Only the last `# [expression]` is stripped and evaluated, which allows
# passing further selection expressions through for onward processing.
#
# Expression values supported:
# - Platform e.g. `osx`, `win` or `linux`
# - `bootstrap`: Whether we are targeting bootstrap.py. This allows us
#   to have advanced conda-build syntax (e.g. jinja templates) while
#   ignoring these when generating the bootstrap dependency list.
# - `prebuilt_cctbx`: Whether we are building cctbx. This is true for
#   bootstrap with CMake and for conda-build builds.
# - Compound expressions with `and` e.g. `osx and bootstrap`. This will
#   work with `not`-expressions, but nothing more complex.
