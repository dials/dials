    Extension to calculate a radial profile threshold. This method calculates
    background value and iqr in 2θ shells, then sets a threshold at a level
    n_iqr above the radial background. As such, it is important to have the
    beam centre correct and to mask out any significant shadows. The method may
    be particularly useful for electron diffraction images, where there can be
    considerable inelastic scatter around low resolution spots. In addition, the
    algorithm is relatively insensitive to noise properties of the detector.
    This helps for the case of integrating detectors with poorly known gain
    and response statistics.

    A similar algorithm is available in other programs. The description of
    'peakfinder 8' in https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576714007626 was helpful
    in the development of this method.
