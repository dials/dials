X-ray crystallography for structural biology has benefited greatly from a number of advances in recent years including high performance pixel array detectors, new beamlines capable of delivering micron and sub-micron focus and new light sources such as X-FELs. The DIALS project is a collaborative endeavour to develop new diffraction integration software to meet the data analysis requirements presented by these recent advances. There are three end goals: to develop an extensible framework for the development of algorithms to analyse X-ray diffraction data; the implementation of algorithms within this framework and finally a set of user facing tools using these algorithms to allow integration of data from diffraction experiments on synchrotron and free electron sources.
