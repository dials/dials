X-ray crystallography for structural biology has benefited greatly
from a number of advances in recent years including high performance
pixel array detectors, new beamlines capable of delivering micron and
sub-micron focus and new light sources such as X-FELs. The DIALS
project is a collaborative endeavour to develop new diffraction integration
software to meet the data analysis requirements presented by these
recent advances. There are three end goals: to develop an extensible
framework for the development of algorithms to analyse X-ray
diffraction data; the implementation of algorithms within this
framework and finally a set of user facing tools using these
algorithms to allow integration of data from diffraction experiments
on synchrotron and free electron sources.
