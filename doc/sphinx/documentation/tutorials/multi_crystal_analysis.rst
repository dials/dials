Multi-crystal analysis with DIALS and BLEND: individual vs joint refinement
===========================================================================

Introduction
------------

BLEND_ is a CCP4 program for analysis of multiple data sets. It attempts to
identify isomorphous clusters that may be scaled and merged together to form a
more complete multi-crystal dataset. Clustering in blend is based on the refined
cell parameters from integration, so it is important that these are determined
accurately. Unfortunately, for narrow wedges of data (where BLEND is most
useful) cell refinement may be complicated by issues such as the high
correlation between e.g. the detector distance and the cell volume.

.. _BLEND: http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/blend.html

One solution is to fix detector parameters during cell refinement so that the
detector is the same for every dataset processed. However, this is only feasible
if an accurate detector model is determined ahead of time, which might require
the use of a well-diffracting sacrificial crystal. If we only have the narrow
wedges of data available then it is more complicated to determine what the best
detector model would be to fix.

If we can make the assumption that the beam and detector *did not move* during
and between all of the datasets we collected then we can use DIALS joint
refinement to refine all of the crystal cells *at the same time*, simultaneously
with shared detector and beam models.

In this tutorial, we will attempt to do that for 73 sequences of data collected
from crystals of TehA, a well-diffracting integral membrane protein measured
using *in situ* diffraction from crystallisation plates at room temperature.
Each sequence provides between 4 and 10 degrees of data.

This tutorial is relatively advanced in that it requires high level scripting
of the DIALS command line programs, however candidate scripts are provided and
the tutorial will hopefully be easy enough to follow.

Individual processing
---------------------

We start with a directory full of images. It is easy enough to figure out
which files belong with which sequence from the filename templates, however note
that the pattern between templates is not totally consistent. Most of the sequences
start with the prefix :samp:`xtal`, but some have just :samp:`xta`. One way of
getting around this annoyance would be to use the fact that each dataset has
a single :samp:`*.log` file associated with it and identify the different
datasets that way. However, we would prefer to come up with a protocol that
would work more generally, not just for the TehA data. Happily we  can just
let DIALS figure it out for us::

  dials.import /path/to/TehA/*.cbf

  The following parameters have been modified:

  input {
    experiments = <image files>
  }

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    format: <class 'dxtbx.format.FormatCBFMiniPilatus.FormatCBFMiniPilatus'>
    num images: 2711
    sequences:
      still:    0
      sweep:    73
    num stills: 0
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Writing experiments to imported.expt

With a single command we have determined that there are 73 individual sequences
comprising 2711 total images. Running the following command will give us
information about each one of these datasets::

  dials.show imported.expt

That was a smooth start, but now things get abruptly more difficult.
Before we perform the joint analysis, we want to do the individual analysis
to compare to. This will also give us intermediate files so that we don't have
to start from scratch when setting up the joint refinement job. Essentially
we just want to run a sequence of DIALS commands to process each recorded sequence.
However we can't (currently) split the experimentlist into individual sequences with
a single command. We will have to start again with :program:`dials.import` for
each sequence individually - but we really don't want to run this manually 73
times.

The solution is to write a script that will take the :samp:`imported.expt` as
input, extract the filename templates, and run the same processing commands
for each dataset. This script could be written in BASH, tcsh, perl,
ruby - whatever you feel most comfortable with. However here we will use Python,
or more specifically :program:`dials.python` because we will take advantage of
features in the cctbx to make it easy to write scripts that take advantage
of `parallel execution <https://cctbx.github.io/libtbx/libtbx.easy_mp.html>`_.
Also we would like to read :samp:`imported.expt` with the DIALS API rather than
extracting the sequence templates using something like :program:`grep`.

.. highlight:: python

The script we used to do this is reproduced below. You can copy this into a file,
save it as :samp:`process_TehA.py` and then run it as follows::

  time dials.python process_TehA.py imported.expt

On a Linux desktop with a Core i7 CPU running at 3.07GHz the script took about 8
minutes to run (though file i/o is a significant factor)
and successfully processed 58 datasets. If time is short, you
might like to start running it now before reading the description of what the
script does. If time is *really* short then try uncommenting the line
:samp:`tasklist = tasklist[0:35]` to reduce the number of datasets processed.

    print "Successfully created the following MTZs:"
    for result in good_results:
      print result

We will now describe what is in this script. The first lines are
just imports to bring in modules from the Python standard library as well as
:samp:`easy_run` and :samp:`easy_mp` from :samp:`libtbx` (part of cctbx),
:samp:`serlialize.load` from :samp:`dxtbx` to read in the ExperimentList.
Following that is a definition for the function
:samp:`process_sequence` which will perform all the steps required to process one
dataset from images to unmerged MTZ. The code block under::

  if __name__ == "__main__":

are the lines that are executed when the script starts. First we check that the
script has been passed a path to an experiments file. We then extract the 73 sequences
from this into a list, then get the filename templates from each element in the
list. We associate each of these templates with a number to form a list of
'tasks' to pass into :samp:`process_sequence`, but instead
of doing this in serial we can use :samp:`easy_mp` to run in parallel. This will
be okay because inside :samp:`process_sequence`, we ensure that all results are
written into a new directory. First we use a facility of the :samp:`easy_mp`
module to determine the number of processes to run in parallel and then we submit
the job with :samp:`parallel_map`.

The commands that are inside the function are usual dials commands,
familiar from other tutorials. There are a couple of interesting points
to note though. We know that the correct space group is *H* 3, but it turns out
that if we ask :program:`dials.index` to find an *H* 3 cell right from the start
then many of the sequences fail to index. This is simply because the initial models
contained in :samp:`imported.expt` are too poor to locate a cell with the
symmetry constraints. However, for many of the sequences the indexing program will
refine the *P* 1 solution to the correct cell. For this reason we first run
indexing in *P* 1::

  dials.index imported.expt strong.refl output.experiments=P1_models.expt

and then we feed the refined :file:`P1_models.expt` back into
:program:`dials.index` specifying the correct symmetry::

  dials.index P1_models.expt strong.refl space_group='H 3'

When :program:`dials.index` is passed a :file:`models.expt` containing
a crystal model rather than just a :file:`imported.expt` then it automatically
uses a :samp:`known_orientation` indexer, which avoids doing the basis vector
search again. It uses the basis of the refined *P* 1 cell and just assigns
indices under the assumption of *H* 3 symmetry. The symmetry constraints are
then enforced during the refinement steps carried out by :program:`dials.index`.
This procedure gives us a greater success rate of indexing in *H* 3, and required
no manual intervention.

Following indexing we do scan-static cell refinement::

  dials.refine indexed.expt indexed.refl scan_varying=false outlier.algorithm=tukey

Outlier rejection was switched on in an attempt to avoid any zingers or other
errant spots from affecting our refined cells. Without analysing the data closer
it is not clear whether there are any particularly bad outliers here. We could repeat
the whole analysis with this switched off if we want to investigate more closely,
or look through all the :file:`dials.refine.log` files to see results of the
outlier rejection step.

We don't bother with the time-consuming step of scan-varying refinement, because
it is the scan-static cell that will be written into the MTZ header. Scan-
varying refinement would give us better models for integration but as we will
only be running blend in 'analysis' mode we are in the unusual situation of not
actually caring what the intensities are. In this case, the MTZ file is just a
carrier for the globally refined unit cell!

Following refinement we integrate the data in a very quick and dirty way, simply
to get an MTZ file as fast as possible. This is a terrible way to integrate
data usually!::

  dials.integrate refined.expt indexed.refl profile.fitting=False prediction.d_min=7.0 prediction.d_max=8.1

The :samp:`profile.fitting=False` option ensures we only do summation integration,
no profile fitting, while the :samp:`prediction.dmin=7.0` and
:samp:`prediction.dmax=8.1` options only integrate data between 7.0 and 8.1 Angstroms.
As a result few reflections will be integrated. The MTZ file here is just
being used as a carrier of the cell information into blend. By restricting the
resolution range this way we are making it obvious that the content of the file
is useless for any other purpose.

.. warning::

  Do not use the data produced by this script for scaling and merging. More
  careful processing should be done first!

Finally we use :program:`dials.export` to create an MTZ file::

  dials.export refined.expt integrated.refl intensity=sum mtz.hklout=integrated.mtz

After each of these major steps we check whether the last command ran successfully
by checking for the existence of an expected output file. If the file does not
exist we make no effort to rescue the dataset, we just return early from the
:samp:`process_sequence` function, freeing up a process so that
:samp:`parallel_map` can start up the next.

Analysis of individually processed datasets
-------------------------------------------

The paths to :file:`integrated.mtz` files can be copied directly into a file,
say :file:`individual_mtzs.dat`, and passed to BLEND for analysis::

  echo "END" | blend -a individual_mtzs.dat

The dendrogram resulting from clustering is shown here:

  .. image:: https://dials.github.io/images/multi_crystal_analysis/tree.png

As we can see, the linear cell variation is less than 1%, with an absolute
value of 0.79 Angstroms, indicating good isomorphism amongst the datasets.
If any extreme outliers had been shown by the plot, one can inspect the
file :file:`FINAL_list_of_files.dat` to see which sequence the blend numbering
relates to. These files could then be removed from :file:`individual_mtzs.dat`
before rerunning BLEND.


Joint refinement
----------------

Now that we have done the BLEND analysis for individually processed datasets,
we would like to do joint refinement of the crystals to reduce correlations
between the detector or beam parameters with individual crystals. As motivation
we may look at these correlations for one of these datasets. For example::

  cd sequence_00
  dials.refine indexed.expt indexed.refl scan_varying=false \
    track_parameter_correlation=true correlation_plot.filename=corrplot.png
  cd ..

The new file :file:`sequence_00/corrplot_X.png` shows correlations between parameters
refined with this single 8 degree dataset (see also correlations in Y and Phi).
Clearly parameters like the detector distance and the crystal metrical matrix
parameters are highly correlated.

 .. image:: https://dials.github.io/images/multi_crystal_analysis/corrplot_X.png

Although the DIALS toolkit has a sophisticated mechanism for modelling
multi-experiment data, the user interface for handling such data is somewhat
limited. In order to do joint refinement of the sequences we need to combine them
into a single multi-experiment :file:`combined.expt` and corresponding
:file:`combined.refl`. Whilst doing this we want to reduce the separate
detector, beam and goniometer models for each experiment into a single shared
model of each type. The program :program:`dials.combine_experiments` can
be used for this, but first we have to prepare an input file with a text editor
listing the individual sequences in order. We can use
:file:`individual_mtzs.dat` as a template to start with. In our case the final
file looks like this::

  input {
    experiments = sequence_00/refined.expt

We called this file :file:`experiments_and_reflections.phil` then run
:program:`dials.combine_experiments` like this::

  dials.combine_experiments experiments_and_reflections.phil \
    reference_from_experiment.beam=0 \
    reference_from_experiment.goniometer=0 \
    reference_from_experiment.detector=0 \
    compare_models=False

The :samp:`reference_from_experiment` options tell the program to replace all
beam, goniometer and detector models in the input experiments with those
models taken from the first experiment, i.e. experiment '0' using 0-based
indexing. If you run without :samp:`compare_models=False`, you'll see that the beam
models are not similar enough to pass the tolerance tests in combine_experiments.
The output lists the number of reflections in each sequence contributing
to the final :file:`combined.refl`::

  --------------------------------------
  | Experiment | Number of reflections |
  --------------------------------------
  | 0          | 1471                  |
  | 1          | 1464                  |

  Saving combined experiments to combined.expt
  Saving combined reflections to combined.refl

We may also inspect the contents of :file:`combined.expt`, by using
:program:`dials.show`, for example::

  dials.show combined.expt

Useful though this is, it is clear how this could become unwieldy as the number
of experiments increases. Work on better interfaces to multi-crystal (or
generally, multi-experiment) data is ongoing within the DIALS project.
Suggestions are always welcome!

Now we have the joint experiments and reflections files we can run our multi-
crystal refinement job::

  dials.refine combined.expt combined.refl \
    scan_varying=false outlier.algorithm=tukey

::

  The following parameters have been modified:

  refinement {
    parameterisation {
      scan_varying = False
    }
    reflections {
      outlier {
        algorithm = null auto mcd *tukey sauter_poon

    }
  }

The overall final RMSDs are 0.16 mm in X, 0.13 mm in Y and 0.11 degrees in
:math:`\phi`. The RMSDs per experiment are also shown, which exhibit significant
variation between datasets.

We can compare the RMSDs from individually refined experiments to those from
the joint experiments. For example, look at the RSMDs for experiment 1, in the
logfile :file:`sequence_01/dials.refine.log`::

  RMSDs by experiment:
  ---------------------------------------------
  | Exp | Nref | RMSD_X  | RMSD_Y  | RMSD_Z   |
  | id  |      | (px)    | (px)    | (images) |
  ---------------------------------------------
  | 0   | 1422 | 0.54278 | 0.30358 | 0.2555   |
  ---------------------------------------------

Clearly allowing the detector and beam to refine only against this data lets
the model better fit the observations, but is it a more accurate description of
reality? Given that we *know* or can comfortably assume that the detector and
beam did not move between data collections, then the constraints applied by
joint refinement seem appropriate. The RMSDs for experiment 1 are not so much
worse than from the individual refinement job. We are happy with this result
and move on to re-integrating the data to create MTZs for BLEND.

It is worth noting that including/excluding outlier rejection can have a
significant effect on the stability of the refinement (although not in this
case). If issues are encountered processing your own data, try without
outlier rejection to see if the result is improved.


Analysis of jointly refined datasets
------------------------------------

We can run :program:`dials.integrate` on the combined datafiles. We'll do
a 'quick and dirty' integration like before, to enable a fair comparison
to be made for the BLEND results::

  dials.integrate combined.refl refined.expt \
    prediction.d_min=7.0 prediction.d_max=8.1 \
    profile.fitting=False

This will integrate each dataset without profile fitting, using multiple
processors, but only between 7.0 and 8.1 Angstrom to produce a quick result
for the purpose of creating the MTZ files for BLEND. Next, we want to
generate mtz files, however :program:`dials.export` can
only export one dataset at a time, so we will first need to separate the
dataset into individual files::

  dials.split_experiments integrated.refl integrated.expt

This will create a series of datafiles from
:file:`split_00.refl`, :file:`split_00.expt` up to
:file:`split_57.refl`, :file:`split_57.expt`.

To export the 58 datasets, we should write a script to avoid having to work
manually. Currently, many DIALS programs such as :program:`dials.export`
can be imported into python scripts as functions to be called directly.
Therefore the script we need is as follows::

  #!/bin/env dials.python
  import logging
  from dxtbx.serialize import load
  from dials.array_family import flex
  from dials.util import log
  from dials.command_line.export import phil_scope, export_mtz

  logger = logging.getLogger("dials.command_line.export")

  if __name__ == "__main__":

    log.config(logfile="export_all.log")

    params = phil_scope.extract()
    params.intensity = ["sum"]

    for i in range(0, 58):
        params.mtz.hklout = "integrated_%02d.mtz" % i
        logger.info("Attempting to export to %s", params.mtz.hklout)
        refl = flex.reflection_table.from_file("split_%02d.refl" % i)
        expts = load.experiment_list("split_%02d.expt" % i, check_format=False)
        export_mtz(params, expts, [refl])

This, if saved as :file:`joint_export.py`, can be run as simply::

  dials.python joint_export.py

This simple script has several key components. The 'phil_scope' contains the
command-line program parameters, which we extract to a 'params' object for the
export_mtz function call. We can override parameters in the params object, in
this example we set the intensity type to export and set a new mtz filename for
each iteration in the loop.
We also need to provide a reflection table and experiment list for each dataset,
which are loaded within the loop and passed to export_mtz. We also create a logger
to capture any output from the export_mtz function, which we have to configure
in the program. For this simple task, where we don't need to take advantage of
parallel processing, this script is sufficient.

As expected this creates all 58 MTZs for the jointly refined sequences without any
problem. We can copy the paths to these into a new file, say
:file:`joint_mtzs.dat`, and run blend::

  echo "END" | blend -a joint_mtzs.dat

The :file:`tree.png` resulting from this is very interesting.

  .. image:: https://dials.github.io/images/multi_crystal_analysis/tree_joint.png

The LCV is now as low as 0.35% (aLCV 0.58 Angstroms). This indicates an even
higher degree of isomorphism than detected during after individual processing.
So although joint refinement leads to slightly higher RMSDs for each experiment
(as we expected) the resulting unit cells are more similar. It is worth
remembering that no restraints were applied between unit cells in refinement.
Given that we know that the detector and beam did not move between the data
collections we might like to think that the joint refinement analysis is a more
accurate depiction of reality, and thus the unit cells are closer to the truth.

What to do next?
----------------

This has given us a good starting point for analysis with BLEND. However, because
of the shortcuts we took with integration we are not yet ready to continue with
BLEND's synthesis mode. At this point we might assess where we are and try a few
things:

* Go back and fix datasets that didn't index properly. We could edit our processing
  script to attempt :samp:`method=fft1d` for example if the 3D FFT indexing was
  unsuccessful.
* Integrate data properly for BLEND's synthesis mode. We should remove the resolution
  limits and allow :program:`dials.integrate` to do profile fitting as well as
  summation integration.
