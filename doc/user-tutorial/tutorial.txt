DIALS Short Tutorial
====================

The aim of this tutorial is to provide a quick start guide to running DIALS for
integrating good quality synchrotron X-ray diffraction data. Many caveats apply
to this:

 - your mileage may vary etc. as the program is in development
 - we don't promise that the data are as good as from e.g. XDS
 - DIALS only does data processing you will need to use e.g. Aimless for
   the subsequent scaling

That said this tutorial illustrates that the program can work and give sensible
results.

Introduction
------------

The philosophy behind DIALS is to be explicit in performing the various steps
of data analysis rather than giving one big tool (though one big tool is
available) - DIALS is first and foremost a toolkit for doing the data analysis
to be used within other systems.

The workflow (if you do things step by step, which is recommended) is as
follows:

 - import the data - this reads the image headers & makes sense of the data,
   forming sweeps etc.
 - find spots - as it says on the tin, can adjust spot size
 - index - index these strong spots, can use a variety of methods
 - refine - refine the experimental geometry (included in indexing for
   scan-static refinement)
 - integrate - actually integrate the data
 - export - create MTZ files

Some detail of the options for each of these will follow below. How they are
used can be seen in tutorial.sh.

Import
------

There are two ways of importing images -

  dials.import /path/to/the/data/*.img

or

  find /path/to/the/data -name *.img | dials.import -i

The latter of these is useful when you have a limited number of command-line
options. This creates datablock.json which is a DIALS description of this data
set.

Find Spots
----------

Most useful parameter here is the minimum spots size. By default it is 6, but
this can be overridden with mini_spot_size=N where N is e.g. 3. This takes
datablock.json and creates strong.pickle:

  dials.find_spots min_spot_size=3 datablock.json

(for example)

Index
-----

The indexing for DIALS offers a substantial number of options - these are
detailed in the Phil file for dials.index, which is shown when you run the
program. The most useful options are:

  unit_cell=a,b,c,al,be,ga
  space_group=P4 (say)
  method=fft3d (say)

The indexing works as

  dials.index strong.pickle datablock.json [options]

and creates an "experiment" file experiment.json which details the crystal
lattices found and indexed.pickle, which is a copy of strong.pickle with
Miller indices and reflection predictions added.

If you are unsure of the symmetry and would like to know how different lattices
look in the refinement, run dials.index not specifying the symmetry and then
run dials.refine_bravais_settings.

Refinement
----------

The indexing includes refinement - if you do not wish to use a time varying
crystal model you can go straight to integration. If you do want to use a time
varying model, you will need to rerun the refinement with this new model as

  dials.refine experiments.json indexed.pickle scan_varying=true

which will generate refined_experiments.json - this you pass on to integration.

Integration
-----------

As may be expected the integration in DIALS offers the greatest range of
user options, to control how the background is determined (including outlier
pixels in the background determination) the reflection profile parameters
(used to define the reflection mask, and by default discovered automatically)
and the actual algorithm to be used for peak integration e.g. sum3d or fft3d.

  dials.integrate outlier.algorithm=null profile.fitting=True \
    refined_experiments.json -r indexed.pickle

This reads the indexed reflections to determine strong reflections for profile
fitting and integrates the data in refined_experiments.json, using the default
background determination with no outlier rejection and XDS-style 3D profile
fitting. These commands are most likely to change and can be viewed by running

  dials.parameters

which shows all of the available options.

Export
------

If you have got this far everything else is easy: export the data as MTZ then
run pointless and aimless to resort and scale the data viz:

  dials.export integrated.pickle refined_experiments.json integrated.mtz
  pointless hklin integrated.mtz hklout sorted.mtz
  aimless hklin sorted.mtz hklout scaled.mtz

For details on pointless and aimless please refer to the CCP4 documentation.
